# BinomialDistribution
BinomialDistribution contains a program written in a jupyter notebook which demonstrates how binomial distribution is calculated given, after defining the proper variables.

The Binomial Distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure.
